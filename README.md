# obstacle_sensor
The file obstacle_sensor.py is run on Raspberry Pi (with pins connected as follows) connected to two ultrasonic sensors and four motors. This device can sense obstacles around it using sensors and based on the distance calculated, motors are run accordingly to change direction. \n
